# Real-Time Coding Collaboration Web Application

This is a web application designed for real-time coding collaboration between a mentor and a student. The application allows the mentor, to share code blocks with the student, and observe changes in real time. The application consists of two main pages: the Lobby page and the Code block page.

## Features

### Lobby Page

The Lobby page provides an overview of available code blocks for selection. There is no need for authentication on this page.

- **Title**: "Choose code block"
- **Code Blocks List**: The page displays a list of code blocks, each represented by a name (e.g., "Async case").
- **Code Block Selection**: Clicking on a code block name will take the user to the corresponding Code block page.

### Code Block Page

On the Code block page, two users can collaborate in real time, with one acting as the mentor (read-only mode) and the other as the student (code editing mode). The first user to access the page will be designated as the mentor.

- **Mentor Mode**: The mentor will see the selected code block in read-only mode.
- **Student Mode**: The student will see the selected code block and have the ability to make changes to the code.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Any code changes made by the student will be displayed in real-time using Socket.io.

## Implementation Details

- The application is built using React for the client-side and Node.js with Express for the server-side.
- Real-time communication between the mentor and student is achieved using Socket.io.
- The application supports JavaScript code only.
- Clear comments have been added to the code for easy understanding and maintenance.

## Deployment

The project is now successfully deployed and accessible online. You can access the live version by following the link below:

The deployment process presented some initial challenges, but through diligent effort and problem-solving, I have managed to overcome them. The project is now fully functional, and real-time collaboration features are operational.

If you encounter any issues or have feedback regarding the live deployment, please feel free to reach out. Your insights are valuable and will contribute to further improvements.

## Local Development

To use the application with full real-time functionality, it is recommended to run the project locally following the steps mentioned in the "Getting Started" section of this README.
## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Russo3007/CodePracticeWebApp/
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd CodePracticeWebApp
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both the client and server.

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server.

   ```bash
   cd server
   node index.js
   ```

5. Start the client.

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

6. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the Lobby page.

## Usage

1. Access the Lobby page to choose a code block.
2. Click on a code block to enter the Code block page.
3. The first user to access the Code block page will be the mentor and see the code block in read-only mode.
4. Any subsequent user accessing the same Code block page will be designated as the student and can edit the code.
5. Real-time changes made by the student will be visible to both the mentor and student.
